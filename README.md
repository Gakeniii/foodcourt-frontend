## Problem Statement
Nextgen is a mall in Nairobi, strategically located along Mombasa Road, attracting thousands of visitors daily. The food court within the mall consists of 20 to 30 outlets offering a variety of cuisines, including Ethiopian, Nigerian, Congolese, and Kenyan food.

Currently, the ordering process is inefficient as multiple waiters from different outlets simultaneously approach customers with menus, often leading to confusion and unintended orders. To streamline this experience, we aim to develop a mobile web application that allows customers to browse menus, place orders, and even book tables in advance.

## Solution (Minimum Viable Product)
The first version of the application must meet the following requirements:

- A **Mobile Web Application** accessible on major browsers.
- A **dashboard for outlet owners** to update their menus and manage orders.
- Outlet owners can optionally register their outlet via the dashboard.
- A **REST API** to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
- Customers should be able to:
  - Select food items and specify quantity before ordering.
  - Add items to a cart and review the order summary before checkout.
  - Filter menu items by **cuisine**, and **category** (e.g., kids' meals, snacks).
  - View mneus, associated outlet information.
  - Successfully placed orders should be stored in the database and optionally displayed in the owner's dashboard.
- Outlet owners should be able to **confirm orders**, notifying customers of estimated serving time.
- Customers can **book tables** 20-30 minutes in advance, with table availability displayed.

## Technologies Used
The Foodie.Eats application is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** Next.js and nextAuth.js for authentication(React Framework)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

Foodie.Eats aims to revolutionize the food court experience by providing a seamless and efficient ordering system for customers and outlet owners alike.
